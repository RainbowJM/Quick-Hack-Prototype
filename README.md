## General
In this repo you will find the assignment we got to create a portfolio of our projects, while using the knowledge of Web App From Scratch and Css to the rescue.

This Portfolio is a single page application, and it's using the github api to get all its informations.

With that all being said, I want to say enjoy this application.

Welcome to my Github Portfolio
