## General
In this repository you will find the assignment we got to create a portfolio of our projects, while using the knowledge of Web App From Scratch and CSS to the rescue.

This Portfolio is a single page application, and it's using the GitHub API to get all its information.

With that all being said, I want to say enjoy this application.

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio
